# Expense_Tracker in Unity 2022.3.0f1

-> A bit complicated because i suck at designing flows 
-> In HUD, 2 elements (Current savings, Reset Button (resets all slots values) )
-> Currently consists of 4 slots which you can customize how much money you want to put in for particular thing in your life
->-> Each slot has 4 elements --
                  1. Item name (particular thing/category to put some portion of your salary. Eg. Family, Food, etc.)
                  2. Item value (amount you want to limit from your salary)
                  3. Edit button (To edit existing Item name & value)
                  4. Deduct button (Everytime you spend, you use this to update your slot value)
-> Follow up on confirming Edit & Deduct changes, it updates Savings value(in HUD) which is your current savings.

THANK YOU!
