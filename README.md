# Expense_Tracker in Unity 2022.3.0f1

-> A bit complicated because i suck at designing flows <br>
-> In HUD, 2 elements (Current savings, Reset Button (resets all slots values) )<br>
-> Currently consists of 4 slots which you can customize how much money you want to put in for particular thing in your life<br>
->-> Each slot has 4 elements --<br>
 &emsp;                 1. Item name (particular thing/category to put some portion of your salary. Eg. Family, Food, etc.)<br>
 &emsp;                 2. Item value (amount you want to limit from your salary)<br>
 &emsp;                 3. Edit button (To edit existing Item name & value)<br>
 &emsp;                 4. Deduct button (Everytime you spend, you use this to update your slot value)<br>
-> Follow up on confirming Edit & Deduct changes, it updates Savings value(in HUD) which is your current savings.<br><br>

THANK YOU!
